# CUNY-Spring-2020

Course material for Interactive Data Visualization (DATA 73200) taught at CUNY Spring Semester, 2020
This repository contains the starter code for each of the 7 tutorials.

First need to make sure the following are installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - version control softwar
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - javascript development software
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - free code editor and IDE (our recommendation)

To get going with the tutorials, open your terminal to the course directory and run:

# Basic Server

Since we will be loading in data files, we need to use a basic server to serve our local files to the browser. To do this, follow the steps below. If you are interested, you can read more about why this is the case [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work), [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server), and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server).

## 'npx serve'

this will start a [simple web server](https://github.com/zeit/serve#readme) that will serve the course files. After you run this line you should see something like the following:

your files will now be available if you go to the following address in your browser `http://localhost:5000.`
