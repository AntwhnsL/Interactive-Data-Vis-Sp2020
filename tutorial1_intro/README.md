# Tutorial 1

This introductory tutorial will focus primarily on helping you get your environment set up for future code development. We will also walk through an example to (a) load in a new dataset and (b) render a simple HTML table to the browser.

The goals for this tutorial are:

- for students to get comfortable with the [Github workflow](../GIT_SETUP.md), and with using their [local development environment](../README.md).
- for students to understand how to load in a dataset using [d3-fetch](https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch) (d3.json, d3.csv, etc.).
- to introduce [d3-selections](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/) and [d3 data binding](https://observablehq.com/@d3/selection-join).
- to give the tools to create a simple [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table).

## Serve and Set Up:

To begin working on your tutorial assignment on your local machine, use your terminal (or git bash, on PC) to navigate to the _root directory_ of your fork. Your path may look different, but the command will look something like this:

```
cd Documents/My\ Repositories/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2020/
```

From this level, (_not from the tutorial folder_), you should run `serve`. When you open  `http://localhost:5000/`, you should see your repository's folder structure. Click into this week's tutorial. The file showing is your `index.html` file. If you want to view the demo file, you have to change your URL path. For example: `http://localhost:5000/tutorial1_intro/demo`.

## Assignment:

1. Review the [demo code](demo/) and understand how the code works
2. Replicate the process for **your own dataset** in the files present in the root of this directory ([index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css), [main.js](main.js))
3. Use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository
4. Post the link to your deployed example on the Commons. **//TODO: check this @Ellie**
   (Note: your link should look something like: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2020/tutorial1_intro/`)
